### Hi there, I'm Kevin Orta. 👋

## I'm a Developer, Climber, and Reader!

<hr>

- Currently a student at Codeup in San Antonio, I am looking forward to making an impact at any company I am hired to! I prefer working on a team, where I can learn and grow from my fellow developers. I hope to one day be working alongside you!

🔭 I’m currently working on my final Capstone project, more info soon...
🌱 I’m currently learning Spring, React & Node! 
👯 I’m looking to collaborate with other developers on anything!
💬 Ask me about: 
Climbing, Bouldering, Let's Climb? 🧗
Developing! As a student, I'm always open to what I don't know! 💻
A joke! I tend to know a few good ones! 🤣
